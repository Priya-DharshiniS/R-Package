**ANALYSIS OF GOOGLE PLAY STORE APP
CATEGORIES DISTRIBUTION USING
SHINY AND PLOTLY**

**1.ANALYSIS ABOUT THE APPLICATION**

This Shiny application serves as a user-friendly interface to explore and understand the
distribution of apps within various categories in the Google Play Store dataset. By leveraging
interactive elements, such as the "Generate Pie Chart" button, users can dynamically generate a
pie chart that visually represents the proportion of apps across different categories.
Upon clicking the button, the application processes the dataset and generates a pie chart based
on the categorized data. Each slice of the pie represents a specific category, and its size
corresponds to the proportion of apps within that category. This visualization offers users a
clear overview of how apps are distributed across different segments of the Google Play Store.
Furthermore, users have the convenience of downloading the generated pie chart as an HTML
file. This feature enables them to save and share the visualization for further analysis or
presentation purposes.
Overall, this Shiny application provides an interactive and insightful tool for exploring the
categorization of apps within the Google Play Store, facilitating data-driven insights and
decision-making processes

The dataset used in this Shiny application contains information about apps available on the
Google Play Store. It likely includes various attributes of these apps, such as their category,
rating, size, number of installs, price, and more. Each row in the dataset represents a single
app, while the columns contain different characteristics or features associated with each app.
Given the context of the application, the dataset may primarily focus on the categorical
distribution of apps, which means it likely includes information about the categories or genres
to which each app belongs. This categorical data is utilized to generate the pie chart, providing
insights into how apps are distributed across different categories within the Google Play Store
ecosystem.
While the specifics of the dataset are not provided in the code snippet, it is typically structured
in a tabular format, such as a CSV file, where each row corresponds to a specific app and each
column represents a different attribute or characteristic of the apps. This dataset serves as the
foundation for the analysis and visualization performed within the Shiny application.
